<h1>hello, i am</h1>
<h3>ho boon suan (boonsuan1 [at] gmail [dot] com), singapore</h3>
I like thinking about mathematics and computation.
I have ideas, sometimes. Mostly however, ideas have me.



<h2><a href="misc/index.html">(mostly math) stuff i've done</a></h2>

<h2>Et cetera</h2>
Here is some random stuff.
<ul>
	<li>two non-attacking queens
