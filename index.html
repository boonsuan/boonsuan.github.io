I do mathematics and stuff. Currently, I'm serving 
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore>national service</a> in Singapore, and I'll be doing that until February 2022.
After that, who knows?

<p>Here's a puzzle with a pretty solution. Say we have 2n balls, where n of them
are red and n of them are blue. We arrange them randomly in a circle, 
then we choose a ball to start at, where we'll begin to walk clockwise. 
At each step, we keep track of the total number of red and blue balls we've 
seen so far, and we stop walking immediately if we've encountered more blue balls 
than red balls at any point of time. (For instance, if we start at a blue ball, then
we must immediately stop.) Is it always possible to pick a ball to start at where we
can complete a full round? <a href=misc/dyckcycle.gif>A beautiful solution.</a>

Here is an <a href=misc/catalan_recurrence.jpg>illustration</a> I made of the 
recurrence defining the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number>Catalan 
numbers</a>, when interpreted as the number of ways to cut
a convex polygon into triangles. If you're interested to learn more, check out 
Richard Stanley's book "Catalan Numbers" for a treasure trove of delightful 
Catalan curiosities.

<h2>Expository Articles</h2>
The Cauchy–Binet formula can be thought of as a generalization of the classic
identity det(AB) = det(A)det(B) to nonsquare matrices. It has some elegant proofs,
and in this article I present two of them. I did not write about the most elegant
one, however — the proof that uses the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindstr%C3%B6m%E2%80%93Gessel%E2%80%93Viennot_lemma>Lindström–Gessel–Viennot lemma</a>, which provides a combinatorial interpretation for the determinant as counting
systems of non-intersecting paths on the lattice. Do check out Martin Aigner and Günter M. Ziegler's book "Proofs from THE BOOK" for a proof, alongside all sorts of
mathematical goodies.
