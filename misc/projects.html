        <ul>
            <li>
                Graph colorings in mathematics are a useful abstraction with applications to computational problems such as scheduling and allocation. The work above investigates properties of colorings in relation to other invariant properties of graphs, and proves that a certain relationship between these invariants holds for a precise class of graphs that is detailed in the paper. (Honestly, this paper doesn't belong on the arXiv, but I thought it was a good idea a few years back so there it is.)

        <li>
            Measure theory is a technical branch of mathematics investigating the meaning of notions like length, area, and volume. It is part of the foundations of modern analysis and probability theory, and is an indispensible part of any analyst's toolkit, allowing us to give precise meanings to notions of integrals and volumes of complicated spaces.

            Real analysis at this level studies properties of spaces of functions (among other things), which are useful for the analysis of partial differential equations (and interesting in their own right too).

            How fast can a computer program go? Are you sure it can't go even faster? Can you prove that?
            Computational complexity and the idea of computation appear to be very fundamental concepts, 
            showing up everywhere in mathematics and science. [I never finished this…]

            The Cauchy–Binet formula generalizes the fact that the determinant is multiplicative to rectangular matrices. We give two proofs, one using the formalisms of the exterior algebra, and another more algebraic proof.

            Math.StackExchange is an online discussion platform where users can ask and answer questions about mathematics at any level. I have found it very useful in my studies, both through asking questions that I get stuck on and through answering questions of others to solidify my knowledge.

            Here was a fun animation I did using Python, in the Manim Community library, which illustrates a kind of 'Gray code' structure for universal graphs. My animation is featured (<a href='https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc7a.ps.gz'>fasc7a.ps.gz</a>) in the inspirational set of books 'The Art of Computer Programming' by Donald E. Knuth :)
