My name is Ho Boon Suan, and I graduated from one of Singapore's top high schools 
with <a href="/assets/grades.jpeg">really good grades</a>. I am currently 
serving the nation, and I do mathematics in my free time. 
You can reach me at <a href="mailto:boonsuan1@gmail.com">boonsuan1@gmail.com</a>.

_Oh! If only someone would give me time, time, time_ \\
_to do everything properly,_ \\
_to read everything at my own tempo,_ \\
_to take it apart and put it together again._
